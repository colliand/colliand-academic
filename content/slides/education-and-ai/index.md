### Socrates on Writing (Plato's Phaedrus)

"For this invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory. Their trust in writing, produced by external characters which are no part of themselves, will discourage the use of their own memory within them. You have invented an elixir not of memory, but of reminding; and you offer your pupils the appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom, for they will read many things without instruction and will therefore seem [275b] to know many things, when they are for the most part ignorant and hard to get along with, since they are not wise, but only appear wise."

# Purpose of education?

+ transfer knowledge?
+ human self-cultivation?
+ prepare for employment?

All of these? With what emphasis?

“Education is the point at which we decide whether we love the world enough to assume responsibility for it, and by the same token save it from that ruin which except for renewal, except for the coming of the new and the young, would be inevitable. And education, too, is where we decide whether we love our children enough not to expel them from our world and leave them to their own devices, nor to strike from their hands their chance of undertaking something new, something unforeseen by us, but to prepare them in advance for the task of renewing a common world.” -- **Hannah Arendt**

1. Quantified Score: Proportion of correct multiple choice responses on the assessment
2. Mathematical Language: Introducing variables, definitions and/or equations as part of the problem-solving process
3. Visualization: Sketching a diagram and/or graph, or making use of graphing software (e.g. desmos.com)
4. Contextual Reasoning: Referecing real-world properties to gauge the validity of the solution
5. Heuristic View: Making use of tactics such as process of elimination or trial and error
