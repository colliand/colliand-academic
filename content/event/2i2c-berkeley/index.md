title: 2i2c + Berkeley
abstract: "I was invited to share an update on 2i2c's progress to date and to
  suggest ways the organization could collaborate with Berkeley. This
  presentation was delivered to Berkeley's Tech Strategy group and some other
  stakeholders. The group included the technical staff responsible for planning,
  deploying and operating tools to support the Datahub. "
