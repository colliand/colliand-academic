title: Communities of practice for Jupyter deployments on shared infrastructure
abstract: Projects like Pangeo and education-driven deployments like the UC
  Berkeley DataHub have demonstrated the power of assembling open tools,
  deploying them on the cloud and making them available to researchers and
  students. Similarly, in Canada, the Syzygy (https://syzygy.ca) and Callysto
  (https://callysto.ca) projects, which deploy JupyterHubs for researchers and
  grades 5-12 classrooms across the country, are victims of “catastrophic
  success,” where use of the hubs and interest for expansion of services (e.g.
  custom Pangeo-like hubs for research projects or workshops) is increasing much
  more rapidly than anticipated. In the Canadian context, this rapid growth in
  demand is driving ideas for the creation of a nonprofit organization whose
  mission is to support people who are engaged in interactive computing. The
  organization, International Interactive Computing Collaboration (2i2c), would
  be seeded in Canada with the intention of fostering a global network of people
  invested in advancing interactive computing, openly sharing software and best
  practices, and advocating for the continued development of cloud agnostic
  infrastructure. In this session, we will give a brief overview of the Syzygy
  project, introduce the vision of 2i2c and discuss with participants how such a
  nonprofit organization could benefit the broader community, and what
  principles it should follow to successfully grow into an international network
  where individual nodes can fulfill national/regional missions.
