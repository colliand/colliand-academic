abstract: We report the observation of the thermal equilibrium strain fluctuation
  spectrum in a transducer using a fiber interferometer. The thermal noise power spectrum
  in the range of 20--30 kHz of the metallic glass cylinder in this experiment is
  determined by the dynamic elastic susceptibility and has peak value corresponding
  to approximately 0.8 $μ$rad/Hz at 25.5 kHz. The data are analyzed by using the fluctuation--dissipation
  theorem and a coupled-mode model for dynamic response in metallic glass.
