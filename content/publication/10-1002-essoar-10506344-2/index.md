abstract: The core tools of science (data, software, and computers) are undergoing
  a rapid and historic evolution, changing what questions scientists ask and how they
  find answers. Earth science data are being transformed into new formats optimized
  for cloud storage that enable rapid analysis of multi-petabyte datasets. Datasets
  are moving from archive centers to vast cloud data storage, adjacent to massive
  server farms. Open source cloud-based data science platforms, accessed through a
  web-browser window, are enabling advanced, collaborative, interdisciplinary science
  to be performed wherever scientists can connect to the internet. Specialized software
  and hardware for machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI/ML) are being
  integrated into data science platforms, making them more accessible to average scientists.
  Increasing amounts of data and computational power in the cloud are unlocking new
  approaches for data-driven discovery. For the first time, it is truly feasible for
  scientists to bring their analysis to data in the cloud without specialized cloud
  computing knowledge. This shift in paradigm has the potential to lower the threshold
  for entry, expand the science community, and increase opportunities for collaboration
  while promoting scientific innovation, transparency, and reproducibility.  Yet,
  we have all witnessed promising new tools which seem harmless and beneficial at
  the outset become damaging or limiting. What do we need to consider as this new
  way of doing science is evolving?
